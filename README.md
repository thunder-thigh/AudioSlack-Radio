# AudioSlack-Radio
AudioSlack is a college radio started in 2025. AudioSlack keeps focus on being lightweight, easy to setup and share.

Radio works locally. Just need to port forward and link to domain for global access. 

Still haven't uploaded source code because I am refining things.
Expected feature set by June 2025:
1. Global radio
2. Custom streams for user input using OBS.
3. Improving user input stream permissions
4. Seperate mount points for each sharing party.
5. Panel/Dock to manage all and every running process.
6. Categorization of uploaded music on basis of tags.
8. Custom streams could enable podcast on the radio channels
9. Hopefully turning this into a college level club

Expected feature set by May 2025:
1. Global hosted and functioning website.
2. UI/UX overhaul (add dial like rustic feel to website)
3. Better performance
4. Apply for kalej club
